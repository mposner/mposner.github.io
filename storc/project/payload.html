	  <h2>Drift Model</h2>
	  
	  <p>
	    The payload drift model is based on a linear
	    approximation of drift used in military
	    applications <sup><a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/policy/army/fm/57-38/Ch6.htm">[example]</a></sup>. The model takes into account the
	    altitude of the drop and the velocity of the wind in
	    both the longitudinal and latitudinal directions. It
	    can be formulated as <img src="pics/payload_eqn.png"/>.  We
	    first calibrated the model using real test data to find the drift
	    coefficient, K, which is a function of the parachute and
	    payload parameters. Once the drift coefficient was
	    found, the model can be used to calculate the drift of
	    the parachute in each direction.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Five different test payload drops were conducted to determine the
	    drift coefficient. A map of these test drops is
	    shown on the left below. These test drops were conducted
	    under various wind speeds and resulted in a wide
	    distribution of drift radius. The plot below right shows the linear
	    relationship between drift and the product of wind
	    speed and altitude, the slope of which is the experimental
	    drift coefficient (K = 0.2564). This plot is obviously
	    sparse and we would have liked to collect more data if
	    we had the time for more flight tests.  We also wish we
	    had the time to validate this drift model with
	    additional drop tests.
	  </p>

	  <h2>Wind Data</h2>


	  <p> To integrate the drift model into our payload drop
	    process, we need to provide it with some data, namely
	    the wind velocity as well as altitude of the drop. To
	    obtain the current wind speed on the aircraft, we calculate the difference
	    between the GPS ground speed and the airspeed as
	    measured by the Pitot probe (see example below left). 
	    This wind speed data is recorded
	    with GPS heading data during the entire ascent of the
	    aircraft, creating a 3-dimensional wind profile of the 
	    ascent (see example below right). Once a
	    constant cruise altitude is reached, the average wind
	    speed in the East-West and North-South
	    directions is used to calculate the drift the
	    parachute is expected to undergo in each direction
	    according to the linear model.
	  </p>

	  <br/>

	  <div class="row-fluid" style="text-align:center; valign:middle;">
	    <div class="span6">
	      <img src="pics/payload_airspeed.png" />
	    </div>
	    
	    <div class="span6">
	      <img src="pics/payload_windprofile.png" />
	    </div>
	    
	  </div>

	  <p>
	    The target location is then offset by the magnitude of the
	    drift component in each direction to obtain the
	    final drop location.  This is the location the
	    airplane should drop the payload so that it will drift
	    to the original intended target location. This drop
	    location becomes the airplane's new destination.  Once
	    the airplane reaches the location, the payload release
	    mechanism is activated to release the payload.
	  </p>
	  
	  <br/>

	  <h2>Release Mechanism</h2>
	  
	  <p>
	    We iterated through several different designs for our
	    payload release.  Most designs involved servos either
	    dropping dispensable doors or un-hinging
	    compartments.  The payload release mechanism was also
	    influenced significantly by our choice of aircraft.
	    When we were thinking of using the Raven RQ-11, we had
	    much more room to design in than with the SuperCub.
	    In the end, we went with a simple servo mechanism that
	    released a hinged door, due to the space constraints
	    of the Supercub.
