	  <h2>Flight Testing</h2>
	  
	  <p>
	    Testing our airplane through full-scale flight testing
	    was an integral component of our project.  Since we were
	    based on Penn's campus in Philadelphia, we didn't have
	    much room to fly around campus (too many buildings,
	    people, etc...).  However, just north of us along the
	    Schuylkill river are some nice park areas that are a part of
	    Fairmount Park.  West Fairmount Park has open fields
	    and baseball diamonds, which were perfect for our purposes
	    and not too far away.  On several occasions we saw others
	    flying RC airplanes and enjoyed talking to them about
	    their planes.  The majority of our tests took
	    place at sunrise (wind conditions are often more ideal
	    earlier in the morning) and would last for several hours
	    depending on our testing plans, weather, and severity of
	    crash damage.  See
	    the <a href="../pictures.html">Picture</a>
	    and <a href="../videos.html">Video</a> galleries for more
	    info about our flight tests.
	  </p>

	  <h2>Flight Dynamics: Model Validation</h2>
	  
	  <p>
	    Before using the plane dynamics model to choose gain
	    values and settle on our controls scheme, validation
	    of the theory through comparison with test data was
	    necessary. The plots on the right show actual elevator and
	    rudder input from ten seconds of a test flight. The
	    red and black lines compare the actual pitch and roll
	    rates measured by the plane's gyroscopes to the
	    plane's reactions as predicted by the model.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    It is clear that the model predicts the pitch response
	    of the aircraft
	    very well. The model does not correlate exactly with
	    every feature of the roll response, but overall the
	    correlation is strong enough for the model to be
	    useful in testing and validating the controls. While
	    elevator is directly correlated to pitch, rudder is
	    typically used to control yaw. More sophisticated
	    aircraft use ailerons to control roll, but since the
	    SuperCub does not have ailerons, rudder is used as a
	    substitute. Therefore, the relationship between rudder
	    and roll is less direct.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    After validating the model
	    with several segments of test flight, it was used as
	    an effective way to test different controls schemes
	    and their effects on the plane. Using this model gave
	    insight into the results of tweaking gains or
	    overhauling the architecture without the need for
	    potentially dangerous test
	    flights. This portion of the project was one of the
	    most valuable and has the ability to be
	    adapted for use on large scale UAVs with only minor
	    changes to the motor model and certain physical
	    characteristics of the plane.

	  <h2>Controls Evaluation</h2>
	      
	  <div class="row-fluid">
	    <div class="span5">
	      
	      <p>
		The controls model provided an excellent starting point for
		estimating gain values. However, since no model is
		perfectly accurate, it was important to be able to
		fine-tune these controls gains in real-time flight
		tests. The dial knobs on our radio
		controller were used when needed in flight tests to
		adjust the control gains around their nominal value.
		The plot to the right shows these gain adjustments
		during one of our flight tests.
	      </p>
	      <p>
		In order to evaluate the success of our controls
		algorithm, we can observe the difference between the
		commanded (desired) input and the airplane's resulting
		motion.  In the figure below, the red line shows
		bank angle commands that were sent to
		the airplane during one test flight. The blue line
		shows the actual airplane bank angle that was measured
		by the on-board sensors. The close match between these
		two graphs shows that the autonomous rudder PID
		control algorithm provides satisfactory results in
		flight.

	  <h2>Software Evaluation</h2>

	  <p>
	    Numerous ground tests were conducted to ensure that
	    software and hardware adjustments were performing as
	    expected without risking the entire system in a flight
	    test. These ground tests were performed on each component
	    and iteration of the system individually. Tests included
	    quantification of GPS position and speed accuracy (running
	    across a known distance outside),
	    testing of orientation, Pitot airspeed (wind tunnel
	    testing), temperature and barometer sensors (taking
	    data at every floor of a high rise of known height),
	    on-board and telemetry logging, navigation,
	    controls and servo deflections, and servo release mechanisms.
