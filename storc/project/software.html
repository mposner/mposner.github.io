	  <h2>ArduPilot Mega <small>Arduino</small></h2>
 
	  <p>
	    As previously mentioned, we have chosen to use a custom
	    Arduino board called the ArduPilot Mega as our
	    microcontroller.  The ArduPilot project actually has a
	    software and code solution as well, but we decided to
	    write our own code for the board.  Since the ArduPilot
	    project is meant to be a general solution package for many
	    platforms (RC airplane, quadrotor, helicopter, etc), its
	    code is inherently large and complex.  In addition, it is
	    not well documented.  We wanted to make sure we understood
	    everything that occurred on the board, and so we wrote our
	    own code to better meet our specific needs and be easier
	    to tweak as we tried different control schemes.  We did
	    keep the sensor libraries for reading data from the sensor
	    shield as these would have been difficult to replicate,
	    are unique to this board implementation, and are not the
	    focus of our project.  We also hacked and incorporated the
	    ArduPilot code so that we could use the ArduPilot Mission
	    Planner software to download the contents of the flash
	    memory logs to a computer.
	  </p>

	      <p>
		Our Arduino code consists of three main loops that run at
		varied intervals. This is because timing is important
		for our application, and so we didn't want to bog the
		board down with unnecessary calculations.  The slow
		loop runs at a frequency of 5
		Hz and is responsible for reading sensors such as GPS and
		barometer that take longer to update, as well as running
		components of our code that are not speed-essential like
		the navigation loop. The medium loop runs at a frequency
		of 25 Hz and is responsible for updating more essential
		sensors such as the accelerometer, gyroscope,
		magnetometer, and Pitot probe. This loop also runs
		portions of our algorithm such as our controls inner loop
		and wind profile generation. The fastest loop runs at the
		full speed of the board and is responsible for dictating
		when the other loops run, updating the plane's current
		orientation estimate, reading RC commands and sending
		servo commands. There are also loops that transmit
		telemetry data and log data in the on-board flash memory
		that run at 5 and 15 Hz, respectively.
	      </p>

	      <p>
		In manual mode, the software reads signals from the RC
		input.  These signals are then passed to the controls
		functions, which use the RC signals along with current
		sensor data regarding GPS location and heading, plane orientation
		and speed in order to figure out what commands need to
		be sent to the throttle, rudder, and elevator to keep
		the airplane flying along the desired course.  In
		autonomous mode, the command signals are generated
		from the navigation code instead of read from the RC
		input.
	      </p>
	      
	      <p>
		In addition, the software determines when to release
		the payload using the plane's GPS coordinates, logs
		data to the onboard flash memory, and sends data via
		the XBee tranciever to the laptop on the ground for
		real-time plotting and additional backup logging.

		A MATLAB script was written in order to receive and
		process telemetry data transmitted from the
		airplane. This allows a wide variety of sensor data and
		other information to be viewed through real-time text
		and graphs. This is important to make sure that the
		system is correctly functioning before a flight test
		as well as to see how the plane is reacting to pilot
		or controls changes during flight. The script reads in
		data using a serial protocol over USB from the ground
		XBee module and processes it for display. The graphs
		display the data in a moving window of 30 seconds, but
		the script also logs data to text files (in the same
		format as the on-board logging) in order to provide a backup
		method of data collection in case of failure of the
		on-board logging system.  A sample telemetry output
		can be seen on the left.

	      <p>
		A second MATLAB script was implemented in order to
		process flight data from either the flash memory logs
		or the telemetry logs. This script generates a wide
		variety of graphs, from sensor and RC data to the
		state of the navigation and controls algorithms at all
		times during the flight. This enables flight data to
		be reviewed in detail at a later time in order to gain
		information about how the plane reacted and how the
		software performed so that adjustments can be made.
		At left is an example GPS output of a flight,
		depicting GPS position, heading and speed at one
