                        <p> I currently work as a System Software Engineer.
                        I earned a Masters degree in Robotics as well as my Bachelors degrees in
                        Computer Science and in Mechanical Engineering from the University
                        of Pennsylvania.  My interests include robotics, embedded systems,
                        aerospace, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and distributed systems.

                                        IR phototransistors, Wiimote IR cameras, wireless modules, motors,

                                                Robockey rink (<a href="http://medesign.seas.upenn.edu/index.php/Courses/MEAM510-11C-ROBOCKEY">source</a>)
                                            </div>
                                        </div>
                                        <p> Two teams face off in a rink approximately 7.5 ft by 4 ft in size.  Each team fields
                                            three robots which must fit inside a 13cm-tall cylinder with a diameter of 15cm.  A goal 
											is scored if the puck crosses the opposing team's goal line.
                                            Play is divided into two one-minute halves, with halftime and timeouts lasting 30 seconds each.
                                            If the score is tied at the end of regulation, another half is played following a second
                                            halftime, and if play is still tied a best-of-three shootout decides the winning team.
                                        </p>
                                        <p> Two key elements of the rink are augmented to assist the robots.  First, the puck consists
                                            of a clear plastic cylinder 3 inches in diameter and 1 inch high.  Inside the puck there 
                                            is a ring of equally spaced IR LEDs.  The robots use this IR light to locate the puck.
                                            Second, there is a constellation of 4 IR LED clusters hung 5 meters above the center of
                                            the rink.  The robots use this cluster to locate and orient themselves on the rink.
                                        </p>
                                    
                                    <h3> Design </h3>
                                        
                                        <p> In order to find the puck, we needed to place IR phototransistors on our robots.  We used three 
											phototransistors, one on each side of the robot and one facing forward.  This allowed us to narrow 
											down the puck's location by observing the difference in signal strength between the left, right, 
											and center phototransistors and adjusting our heading to keep the puck in front of the robot.
										</p>

										<p> In order to detect when the robot had successfully collected the puck, we had originally planned
											to use limit switches placed in the front of the robot. The rules stated that the robot could not
											enclose more than 20% of the puck's area when viewed from above, so this limited our options for
											detection and transportation.  After some testing we determined that the constant switch bouncing
											that would occur as the robot pushed the puck would make it difficult for software to accurately 
											determine whether the robot was still in control of the puck.  We decided to add another phototransistor
											in the front of the robot that was angled inwards towards the body of the robot and shielded.  This
											would prevent false triggering of the phototransistor when the puck was not close to the robot, but
											give us a more reliable mechanism to detect whether the robot was in control of the puck.
										</p>
                                        
										<p> Unlike regular hockey, shooting the puck was not a necessary component to this game.  Many teams 
											relied on simply trying to push the puck into the goal.  However we decided early on that to make 
											it more fun	we would try to give our robot the ability to shoot the puck.  We settled on using a 
											solenoid because of its speed and the force we would require to shoot the puck.  We quickly discovered 
											that the puck was quite heavy and we would need large solenoids in order to shoot.  We dedicated 
											the lower center of our two forward robots to solenoids. 
										</p>
										<p> Another important part of this competition was the choice of robot size and weight.  Some teams chose
											to design robots that were very light and fast.  Our team chose to do the opposite, and build a 
											heavier robot that would hold its ground better.  The large solenoid and multiple batteries helped
											keep us from being pushed around and gave our wheels better traction.
                                        </p>
										<p> After designing all of our robots with SolidWorks, we used the school's laser cutters to create them.
                                            The robots consisted of several layers of laser-cut acrylic, connected with bolts and standoffs.  We
                                            went through several iterations of laser-cut designs as we adjusted the mounting and fit of various
                                            components.  We also fabricated the wheels out of acryclic, and added rubber bands to the edges for 
                                            traction.

                                        <p> We soldered together our own motor driver boards and phototransistor circuits onto perfboards.
                                            We used potentiometers in the phototransistor circuts so that we could easily tune the sensitivity of the
                                            phototransistors.  This is important because the amount of ambient IR light present in the environment
                                            had a significant impact on their measurements.  The phototransistors had to be adjusted when switching
                                            from a dark room to a bright room and even between daytime and nighttime.  We also added several switches
                                            and wired up an 8 segment display to our robot to help aid in debugging our code.
                                        </p>

											Since we wanted large solenoids in order to shoot the puck, this meant that our solenoids would have 
                                            to be high voltage (~12V), which also implied that
											they would draw significant current.  These requirements led us to choose LiPo batteries to power 
											the solenoids because of their high discharge rates.  The LiPo battery was separate from the main
											power system on the robot, which consisted of two packs of 6 AA batteries.  These batteries supplied sufficient
											power to the microcontroller and sensors as well as the motors.

                                        The robots navigated the rink by using their Wiimote IR cameras to view a 
                                        &quot;constellation&quot; of IR LEDs placed above the rink, and communicated with each 
                                        other in order to coordinate attacks on the puck (and avoid running into each 
                                        other).  Our goalie was designed to move back and forth along the goal crease 
                                        and block the puck (which was ringed by a number of IR LEDs).  Our two forward 
                                        robots were designed to find the puck, move towards it, then steer it towards 
                                        the opposing goal (but also away from our own goal), get within range, and 
                                        then shoot the puck using a solenoid.  I also created a diagnostic display 
                                        in MATLAB to observe robot data and calculated field position.  Our robots 
                                        placed in the top 8 out of a field of 25 teams.
